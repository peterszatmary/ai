[Hyperparameters]({{site.url}}{{site.prod}}/hyperparameters.html)
[Cost function]({{site.url}}{{site.prod}}/cost-function.html)

### Definition

> "controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated"


Is one of [Hyperparameters]({{site.url}}{{site.prod}}/hyperparameters.html) used to train the model.

### Possible problems

#### Learning rate to low 

- training of the model will progress very slowly as we are making minimal updates on weights.

#### Learning rate to high

- divergent behaviour to the [cost function]({{site.url}}{{site.prod}}/cost-function.html) because of drastic updates on weights.
