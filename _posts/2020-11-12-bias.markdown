[Activation function]({{site.url}}{{site.prod}}/activation-function.html)

### Definition

> "In artificial neural networks, the word bias has two meanings:[^1]
>   
>  - It can mean a bias neuron, which is part of the structure of the neural network. It is added to each neuron.
>  - It can mean bias as a statistical concept, which reflects how well the network is able to generate predictions 
>  based on the training samples you provide."


### The Bias neuron

- Bias (Offset) it is an extra input to neurons and it is always 1, and has it’s own connection weight. 
- This makes sure that even when all the inputs are none (all 0’s) there’s gonna be an [activation in the neuron]({{site.url}}{{site.prod}}/activation-function.html).[^2]

- In many cases it’s necessary to move the entire activation function to 
 the left or to the right, upwards or downwards, to generate the required output values; 
 the bias neuron makes this possible.[^1]

### The Bias as a statistical concept

- reflects how well the model fits the training set. 
- **A high bias** means the neural network is not able to generate correct predictions even for the examples it trained on.
 
### Variance

- on other hand there is variance
- reflects how well the model fits unseen examples in the validation set.  
- **A high variance** means the neural network is not able to correctly predict for new examples it hasn’t seen before.
