### Is used

- on language and on sequential data (time series data) for example (written text, video, audio, or multiple events that
 occur one after the other, as in networking or security analytics, stock predictions)
- Language modeling and text generation
- Machine translation from language to language
- Speech recognition
- Generating image description
