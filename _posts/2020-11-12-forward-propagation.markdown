### Definition

> "Forward propagation is a process of feeding input values to the neural network and getting an output which we call predicted value."


- Sometimes we refer forward propagation as inference. When we feed the input values to the neural networkâ€™s first layer, 
it goes without any operations. Second layer takes values from first layer and applies multiplication, addition and activation 
operations and passes this value to the next layer. Same process repeats for subsequent layers and finally we get an output value from the last layer.
